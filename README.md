Machine learning algorithms in recommender systems typically fit into two categories: content-based systems and collaborative filtering systems. Modern recommender systems combine both approaches.

We will be creating a content-based recommender.
# Content-Based Movie Recommendation Systems:

Content-based methods are based on the similarity of movie attributes. Using this type of recommender system, if a user watches one movie, similar movies are recommended. For example, if a user watches a comedy movie starring Adam Sandler, the system will recommend them movies in the same genre or starring the same actor, or both. With this in mind, the input for building a content-based recommender system is movie attributes.
